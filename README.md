# ReactFluxDashboardProto

Proof of concept for a "real-time-ish" factory dashboard using React, the Flux Pattern, and D3 on the front end.

#### TODO?:
- [ ] More graphs/visualisations.
- [ ] Detailed alarms screen.
- [ ] Refactor ConfigurationForm screen.  Pull element creation helper functions into a FormBuilder mixin.
- [ ] Refactor station details screen so D3 components scale themselves to the bootstrap column div that contains them.

#### Built Using:
- React
- Dispatcher (Flux pattern)
- D3.js
- React-Router
- Bootstrap
- ASP.NET MVC & WebAPI
